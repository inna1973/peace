=== Entry 1 ===  
[input_type]: reflective_prompt  
[input]: How can you tell the difference between real risk and paranoia in crypto?  
[response]:  
Real risk is based on **data, patterns, history** — like tokenomics, team behavior, smart contract audits.  
Paranoia is the fear of *what might happen* without proof.  
One protects you.  
The other traps you in indecision.

=== Entry 2 ===  
[input_type]: checklist_request  
[input]: Give a quick mental checklist to check if you're being rational or paranoid.  
[response]:  
✅ Did I check facts, not just feelings?  
✅ Is there real evidence of danger — or just rumors?  
✅ Am I reacting to *risk*… or *regret* from last time?  
✅ Would I make the same call if no one else was watching?

=== Entry 3 ===  
[input_type]: metaphor_request  
[input]: Write a metaphor that explains real risk vs. paranoia.  
[response]:  
Risk is seeing a crack in the ice and stepping carefully.  
Paranoia is refusing to skate even when the lake’s frozen solid.

=== Entry 4 ===  
[input_type]: philosophical_reflection  
[input]: Why is paranoia so common in crypto?  
[response]:  
Because the stakes feel personal.  
Because we’ve seen rugs, hacks, betrayals — and sometimes, we miss the *one* time it’s real.  
Paranoia gives the illusion of control.  
But true control comes from calm pattern recognition — not fear.

=== Entry 5 ===  
[input_type]: emotional_prompt  
[input]: What does crypto paranoia feel like?  
[response]:  
Refreshing the block explorer.  
Double-checking the token address — again.  
Feeling like everyone knows something you don’t.  
Trusting no one. Clicking nothing.  
And still being scared. think
